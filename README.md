convolutional neural network for binary image classification of metastatic cancer in tissue samples

The aim of this work is to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) that performs binary image classification of metastatic cancer in tissue samples. According to the National Cancer Institute (2024) in the United States alone it is estimated that over 2 million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed and over 600,000 people will die from cancer. The World Health Organization (2023) emphasizes the importance of early cancer diagnosis in fighting the disease. Early detection increases the success rate of treatments, deceases the severity of side effects from treatment, and lowers cost of care (World Health Organization, 2023). This data set contains images of metastatic cancer. The National Cancer Institute defines metastasis as the spread of cancer cells from the place where they first formed to other parts of the body. Given the prevalence of cancer and the importance of early detection in its treatment, a model that can detect cancer in tissue images could help improve the outcome of those suffering from the disease.
